## Model Details
-This is a project by Lilian Castro for Udacity Machine Learning DevOps course.
This is a Classification model used on public Census Bureau data, using the Random Forest Classifier.

## Intended Use
This model was intended as a school project. This model is designed to be used with categorical and numerical data. It handles large datasets well. It also takes into consideration missing values. 

## Training Data
The training data was a sample of the census Bureau dataset. This was preprocessed using the process data function.

## Evaluation Data
The dataset chosen was provided by Udacity and is a census Bureau dataset. This was preprocessed with process data function.

## Metrics
Metrics used on this dataset were precision, recall, & F beta score. The precision score was 80% indicating high accuracy. 
The recall score was 53% which is an average score. 
The F beta score is at 64% which is above average. That means this model gives more weight to precision. 

## Ethical Considerations
This is a publicly available dataset from the Census Bureau so there are no ethical considerations. 

## Caveats and Recommendations
There are no caveats or recommendations.
